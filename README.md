# About the app
Video Journal lets you record and collect videos. It will generate combined montage of videos for each week. 
Scroll through your memories and see them autoplay. Share your videos. Set a reminder to take daily videos and keep adding new ones.

# Setup
Download this repo and open it in Android Studio.

# Technologies
I use ExoPlayer and a custom RecyclerView to autoplay videos. I use Room and LiveData to manage data. I implement camera functionality using Camera2 API.
